Rather than having to go to a website or go on my phone, this app was created so that all information such as the time and current crypto information could be seen at a quick glance from an unused tablet on my desk. The clock currently works best on an Amazon Fire tablet (in landscape), but it will eventually be responsive so that it can work on any tablet. This is a work in progress and will be updated over time.
